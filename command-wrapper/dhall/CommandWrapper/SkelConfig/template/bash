#
# *   Redirecting help message, e.g. `TOOLSET_COMMAND help SUBCOMMAND | less`
#     will work as expected.
#
# *   Using subcommand in a pipeline.  E.g.
#     `TOOLSET_COMMAND SUBCOMMAND [ARGUMENT [...]] | SOME_COMMAND` will not
#     pass help message as an input to `SOME_COMMAND` if there was an error.

# Read configuration file in Dhall format and declare Bash variables based on

# format, however, if you are more comfortable with JSON or YAML then there
# are tools to convert Dhall into them:
#
# * 'dhall-to-json'
# * 'dhall-to-yaml'
#
# Best approach in such case would be to create a temporary file with
# JSON/YAML content that is then used as a configuration file instead.

# Note that Subcommands aren't required to use configuration files.  If you
# don't need to use it then delete this function and relevant code in the
# 'main' function.

# expects configuration to be a record where individual fields are primitive

# command, specifically `--dhall-bash` functionality.
